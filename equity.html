        <h2>Nifty P/E Ratio</h2>
        <h3>What is it all about?</h3>
        <p>Full form of PE ratio is price to earnings ratio and it is broadly used to identify how cheap or expensive a particular index (such as Nifty – Nifty PE ratio - See the Nift PE Chart) or a particular stock such as (TCS – TCS PE ratio) is. Simply put P/E ratio implies the amount an investor is willing to pay to earn one rupee as profit. For example, if PE ratio of a company is 25 it means that investors are willing to pay INR 25 for one rupee profit the company earns. Similarly if Nifty PE ratio is 23, it means investors are willing to pay INR 23 for one rupee profit collectively earned by all the companies that are included in Nifty. Nifty PE ratio is provided by NSE India website on daily basis.</p>
        
        <img src="photos/niftypechart.png" alt="" width="100%">
        <p>To track the PE Ratio, I am leaving here a link <a href="https://trendlyne.com/equity/PE/NIFTY50/1887/nifty-50-price-to-earning-ratios/" style="color: #fa5b3d;" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
        </p>
        <h3>What to take home from this chart?</h3>
        <p>Nifty PE ratio is important as it is a measure of valuation of all the companies included in Nifty. From long term perspective, low Nifty P/E ratio is considered cheap and ideal for going long. A high Nifty PE multiple on the other hand is assumed to be expensive and warrants caution while taking investment decisions (Booking profit or going short is a better strategy than going long in High PE ratio scenario). The same can be depicted from studying the Nifty PE vs Nifty chart above. When Nifty PE ratio is at its peak (in the range of 25 to 30), nifty is also at its peak and vice versa. It's clear from the chart above that stock market witnesses a sharp sell off when nifty pe is near 25 and witnesses heavy buying when nifty pe ratio is round 12 to 15.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistake Investors make while valuing the market!</h3>
        <p>Investors should not judge nifty index or sensex by its value. Nifty at 8900 and Sensex at 29000 are merely numbers and one needs to take EPS of all the constituent stocks into consideration before making an investment decision. Whether the index is cheap or pricey should be judged on the basis of its PE ratio rather than the value. Based on historical data and pure common sense, investors can safeguard their investment portfolio and earn handsome profit by following the investment rationale suggested in following table.</p>

        <h2>Nifty P/B Ratio</h2>
        <h3>What is Nifty PB Ratio?</h3>
        <p>As with Nifty PE ratio, investors can also investigate Nifty PB ratio to gauge if the market is undervalued or overvalued. Normally, the Nifty P/B ratio value remains <b>between 2 and 5</b> (It crossed 6 in 2008 - A sign of the highly overvalued market - See the Nifty PB chart). Just to understand what Nifty PB ratio means, let’s say the current Nifty P/B multiple is 3. This means that on average, the Nifty 50 companies are valued as much as three times than what is actually present in their books. So as the Nifty PB ratio goes up, the valuation gets expensive and vice versa. Nifty P/B ratio of around <b>2.75 to 3.25 is considered fair</b> as far as market valuation is concerned (Opportunity to hold). <b>P/B of 2 or lower signifies that Nifty is significantly undervalued</b> (Ample opportunity to go long) and <b>P/B of greater than 4.5 signifies Nifty is highly overvalued</b> (Opportunity to book profit).</p>

        <h2>Author's Message</h2>
        <p>The ongoing time is COVID-19 pandemic when i write this to you all. India's lockdown have unfolded into multiple phases of lockdown. During such a time, there are many optimists who were working on themselves whether it is their passion, backlogs or nourishing new skills.
            <br>
            I too found some time for myself and furnished my Web Development Skills from HTML,CSS to Java Script, Node.js and Web Hoisting. Moreover, i think i have recieved the valuable understanding of <emp>STOCK MARKET & MUTUAL FUNDS</emp>. These two skills together threw some light on a thought which has lead to the existence of the site you have landed onto.
            <br>
            I really am not certain where will i end with <emp>The Investocks</emp>, my new platform. I find my friends and even the grown ups oblivion of this great Asset Investment Class. My vision is to provide my readers, specially of my age (currently i am 19) with a user-friendly and dynamic platform to study Stocks, Mutual Funds and Debt Funds in the most simplimistic manner.
            <br>
            Currently Investocks provide views on Mutual Funds and Fundamental Analysis, but i promise you all that i'll continue adding more features, content and tools. Aspiring of creating this site as one of the most helpful & visited sites in India is in itself a great step towards the desired and i hope i do my best for it.
