        <h2>What is SIP ?</h2>
        <img src="photos/sip.png" width="85%" alt="">
        <p>A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), more popularly known as SIP, is a facility offered by mutual funds to the investors to invest in a disciplined manner. SIP facility allows an investor to invest a fixed amount of money at pre-defined intervals in the selected mutual fund scheme. The fixed amount of money can be as low as Rs. 500, while the pre-defined SIP intervals can be on a weekly/monthly/quarterly/semi-annually or annual basis. By taking the SIP route to investments, the investor invests in a time-bound manner without worrying about the market dynamics and stands to benefit in the long-term due to average costing and power of compounding.</p>

        <h2 id="siphead">SIP Calculator</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; border-bottom: solid 1px silver;">A SIP calculator is a simple tool that allows individuals to get an idea of the returns on their mutual fund investments made through SIP. SIP investments in mutual funds have become one of the most popular investment options for millennials lately.
            This calculator will calculate the wealth gain and expected returns for your monthly SIP investment. Indeed, you get a rough estimate on the maturity amount for any of your monthly SIP, based on a projected annual return rate.

        <h2>Author's Message</h2>
        <p>The ongoing time is COVID-19 pandemic when i write this to you all. India's lockdown have unfolded into multiple phases of lockdown. During such a time, there are many optimists who were working on themselves whether it is their passion, backlogs or nourishing new skills.
            <br>
            I too found some time for myself and furnished my Web Development Skills from HTML,CSS to Java Script, Node.js and Web Hoisting. Moreover, i think i have recieved the valuable understanding of <emp>STOCK MARKET & MUTUAL FUNDS</emp>. These two skills together threw some light on a thought which has lead to the existence of the site you have landed onto.
            <br>
            I really am not certain where will i end with <emp>The Investocks</emp>, my new platform. I find my friends and even the grown ups oblivion of this great Asset Investment Class. My vision is to provide my readers, specially of my age (currently i am 19) with a user-friendly and dynamic platform to study Stocks, Mutual Funds and Debt Funds in the most simplimistic manner.
            <br>
            Currently Investocks provide views on Mutual Funds, but i promise you all that i'll continue adding more features, content and tools. Aspiring of creating this site as one of the most helpful & visited sites in India is in itself a great step towards the desired and i hope i do my best for it.
